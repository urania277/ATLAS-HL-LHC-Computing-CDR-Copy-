SLAC Computing Division hosts 1.0~PFLOPS of FP32 GPU compute that is available for general use for SLAC. This system consists of NVIDIA including models Tesla K80, P100, and GeForce 1080Ti. In addition the PIs have access to two dedicated GPU servers, each equipped with 4 of NVIDIA Tesla V100 with NV-Link interconnect for high-bandwidth GPU-GPU communication. These resources will be utilized for ML algorithm development and training for LArTPC experiments. For local data processing, we will utilize local computing cluster at SLAC that provides 21,000 CPU cores over 2,000 on-site server machines. This is available for generic research purpose for SLAC employees. The SLAC neutrino group has access to Cori system at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory through DUNE collaborators for DUNE ND software development.
